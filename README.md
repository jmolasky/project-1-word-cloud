# Project 1: Word Cloud

A simple application that allows the user create a word cloud by either typing into an input field or uploading a .txt file. The user can also choose whether or not to exclude commonly-used words such as "a," "an," "the" etc. and what the minimum number of characters should be for the words in the cloud.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript/jQuery
- Quickchart's Word Cloud API

## Future Enhancements

- The ability to upload larger .txt files to the application to be parsed. I think this might require a proxy server to handle a POST request to the API instead of a GET request.

- The ability to upload other types of files, such as .docx files and PDFs.

- The ability to generate multiple word clouds and compare them to each other.
